# cs171-final-project

You should write a one page README describing how you structured your model and what your model proved. You can assume that anyone reading it will be familiar with your project proposal. Here are some examples of points you might cover:


    What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?

    What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?

    Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?

    How should we understand an instance of your model and what your custom visualization shows?



    
    We chose to model the L game, an abstract sequential 2-player board game where players take turns moving their L-shaped pieces in a 4x4 grid
and then have the option of moving one of the two netural pieces occupying a 1x1 cell. The game ends when it is a player's turn and they are unable
to move their L to a different position, resulting in them losing the game....

    -- structure of the model, tradeoffs, assumptions, scope, limitations

    -- what the model proves, testing, change in goals

    -- addition of sudden death variant

    -- instructions for running, understanding instances/visualization
